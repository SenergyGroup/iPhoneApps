# iPhoneApps
Git Pages for the various iPhone apps I created.

## Nameless App
The nameless-app aims to provide helpful reminders and recommendations to the user of the application. It is not intended to act as a replacement for a voice assistant (iPhone's Siri or Amazon's Alexa). The recommendations will come from the data collected by the user, which is stored in Core Data.

The first iteration of the application will provide a recommendation based on commuting times. The recommendations will include: reminders of when to leave for work or events, and recommendations based on weather and mapping API's in the event of possible travel delays.

## Memorize App
The memorize app was created by following along with the Standford University CS193 Spring 2021 course. The lectures are available online at https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/.
